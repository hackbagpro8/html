        <h3>Disstrack on messi</h3>
        <p>Yo, Messi, you're a legend, no doubt, But I'm here to set the record straight, no need to shout. You dribble finesse, yeah, your footwork's insane, But let me show you why I'm the GOAT in this game.<br>

            You score those goals, yeah, with style and grace, But when it comes to trophies, I'm winning the race. Six Ballon d'Ors, yeah, that's my claim to fame, While you're still chasing shadows, trying to catch my flame.<br>
            
            You may have skills, yeah, I'll give you that, But when we face off, you know who wears the crown, in fact. Ronaldo's the name, unmatched in every stat, So step aside, Messi, it's time to face the fact.<br>
            
            You're a magician on the field, I'll give credit where it's due, But when it's crunch time, I always come through. So here's my diss track, straight from the heart, Messi, you're great, but Ronaldo's the art.</p>
